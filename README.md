# HOOD Front End

For this front end to work, the [backend repo](https://github.com/aleahy/hood-app) must already be up and running.

By default, it expects the address for the backend to be http://localhost:8000.

Update the `.env.local` file if this is different.

## Installation Instructions
1. Clone this repository to a folder.
2. Copy the `.env.local.example` file to `.env.local`.
3. Install the requirements and run the server
```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start a server running at http://localhost:3000.
